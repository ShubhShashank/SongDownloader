# YouTubeScraper
a simple webscraping code developed in java using jsoup and ui4j libraries to download something in youtube and convert it into high quality audio format(mp3). It can be used as a song downloader.

Run this command to install system dependencies 

`apt-get install qt5-default libqt5webkit5-dev build-essential python-lxml python-pip xvfb` 
`pip install dryscrape`

Python Based Requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Java Based Requirements:

1. Java 1.8

2. Jsoup library

3. UI4J Library

(install .jar file for each package and put it in the same directory as the file otherwise use IDE for the same.)

Future Plans:

1. Fetch album art and add it to the downloaded mp3 file(using id3 editing libraries)

2. Add Album name, artist name, etc...(using id3 editors)
